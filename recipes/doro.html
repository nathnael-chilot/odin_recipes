    <p>I love Ethiopian food but had difficulty finding authentic recipes online. I ultimately found 3 or 4 recipes and
        altered them all to incorporate them together in an attempt to capture the flavors. Typically served with injera
        and some side vegetable dish. I prefer Atkilt, a cabbage and potato dish, but there are many delicious options.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>¾ cup berbere seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sweet white wine</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, 5 to 6
            minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and tomato paste; stir until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining butter,
            berbere, garlic, and ginger. Adjust heat to low and cook until mixture thickens to paste consistency, 20 to
            30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir remaining water into berbere paste; add chicken. Simmer until thickened to sauce consistency, about 45
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir white wine, cardamom, and black pepper into the sauce; add hard-boiled eggs. Cook until sauce is
            reduced slightly, about 15 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
